### Project Overview

In this project, I've built a Power BI dashboard to analyze sales of a superstore. I've done some basic data cleaning and preprocessing to analyze the data and draw insights from it through the dashboards. I'm keenly interested in data visualization, so in this project, I've tried to work on my dashboarding skills and explore how meaningful insights can be presented through powrer bi dashboards.

### Major steps followed

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing.
2. Creating a calendar table to add timelines and visualize accordingly.
3. Deriving required columns using measures.
4. Data modelling and linking all the tables with their respective primary and foreign keys.
5. Adding appropriate visuals (like a bar chart, column chart, donut chart etc.) for visualizing the sales and profit.
6. Adding KPI cards to showcase important numbers upfront.
7. Adding slicers to slice and dice the data as required.
8. Collating all the visuals and presenting them together in the dashboard.
9. Formatting of the dashboard and the visuals.

### Insights and Findings

1. Canon Advanced copier was the most profitable product and cubify 3d printer beared the most losses.
2. Consumer segment contributed to the most sales and profit, followed by the corporate segment.
3. More focus can be given on Asia to drive the sales further in this vast continet.

### Recommendations and further scope

- I've used a limited number of visuals in this dashboard. Some other visuals can also be explored which can be used to present in the dashboard.
- Cities contributing less frequently in sales can have some additional offers and discounts.
- Insights can also be drawn based on which kind of products are being returned more frequently.
